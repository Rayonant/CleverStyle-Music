# CleverStyle Music
HTML5 application based purely on Web technologies.

Application intended to be used in Firefox OS (should also work in Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and Android if Firefox browser installed).

There are some interesting technologies used here, like [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/) (Web Components) and [Aurora.js](https://github.com/audiocogs/aurora.js) (music playing and decoding of metadata from files)

With current version of music player you can:
* scan and store music library
* generate playlist in normal or random order
* repeat one song, playlist or do not repeat anything
* remember current track in playlist after app restarts (you will not listen the same songs over and over from the beginning)
* create or extend playlist with tracks of specific artist, album, genre, year or rating
* extract meta-tags from music files including album cover and show them in app interface (blurred cover is used as application background)
* obviously, play:) files in formats mp3, mp4, flac and alac
* more features coming soon, feel free to suggest yours
